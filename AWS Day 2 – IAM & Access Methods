# 📘 AWS Day 2 – IAM & Access Methods

---

## 🔐 What is IAM (Identity and Access Management)?
IAM is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users.

- Manage **users**, **groups**, **roles**, and **permissions**.
- Use **policies** to define who can do what (and on which resources).

### Key IAM Components:
- **Users:** Actual people who use AWS services.
- **Groups:** Collection of users with similar permissions.
- **Roles:** Assumed identities with specific permissions (used by services like EC2 or Lambda).
- **Policies:** JSON documents that define permissions.

## 🛠️ Ways to Access AWS

1. **AWS Management Console** (Web-based GUI)
2. **AWS CLI** (Command Line Interface)
3. **AWS SDKs** (For programming languages like Python, Java, etc.)
4. **AWS CloudShell** (Browser-based shell environment)

## ✅ IAM Best Practices

- Enable **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
- Follow **least privilege principle** (Only give necessary permissions)
- Don’t use the **root account** for daily tasks
- Use **groups** for easier permission management
- Regularly **rotate credentials** and **review policies**
- Use **IAM roles** for service-to-service access
